Introduction
==================================================

*lys* is a hybrid graphical- and character-based user interface (GUI/CUI) program for data analysis and visualization.
This is based on the several popular Python libraries:

- Data analysis: numpy, scipy, opencv, dask
- Data visualization: matplotlib, pyqtgraph
- GUIs: PyQt

Data analysis and visualization libraries have been used in CUI such as bare Python and Jupyter notebooks.
Although these CUI environment has played important roles, however, such CUI-based analysis environment has several disadvantages:

- Users should be familiar with many commands of numpy, matplotlib, etc..
- Management of Python code is troublesome when you have many and similar .py files.
- Parallel computation requires some additional coding.
- It is hard to remain editable figures because figures are saved as image file such as .png.
- It is difficult to intuitively edit figures.

*lys* gives the opportunity to avoid these problems by employing hybrid GUI/CUI archtechture while flexibility of CUI system is not lost.

*lys* is composed of several functionalities that process the analysis and visualization:

- CUI:
- lysCanvas:
- MultiCut:
